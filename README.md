Allow your security team better control over managing the safety of your community

## SCMS: A community management software for security teams
SCMS enables security teams of gated communities and country clubs better control over the management of the property.

###  Problem:
- Officers do not have an efficient way to inform residents of discrepancies with their home and around the community
 - Reports being completed manually or using pen and paper
- Too many resources/team members allocated to complete tasks such as: garage door check, house checks, garage door light checks, etc 


### SCMS Solution:
- Residents are kept informed with a simple push of a button
- All reports are either automatically generated by SCMS or completed by officers digitally
- SCMS dramatically reduce the amount of resources needed to perform a task by improving the process to complete a task
