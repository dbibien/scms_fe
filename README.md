## SCMS: A community management software for security teams
SCMS streamlines property management, giving security teams in gated communities and country clubs improved oversight.

###  Problem:
- Officers lack efficient communication tools to effectively notify residents of issues affecting their homes and the broader community
- Reports are being generated manually, utilizing traditional pen-and-paper methods
- Resources and team members are over-allocated to routine tasks like garage door inspections, house checks, garage light evaluations, etc


### SCMS Solution:
- A simple push of a button allows residents to remain informed easily
- All reports are produced either through automatic generation by SCMS or through digital completion by officers
- By optimizing the task completion process, SCMS dramatically cuts down on the resources required
